A cryptocurrency exchange is an online marketplace where you can buy, sell or trade cryptocurrencies.  <a href="blog/which-is-the-best-cryptocurrency-exchange-platform-bittrex-or-poloniex/index.html" target="_blank"> Crypto exchange platform</a> is beneficial for crypto users as it helps to set off their crypto wheels in motion without any resistance.</p>

				<img class="img-fluid margin-50" src="image/img/blockchain-sol/platform-work-img.png">
			</div>
			<p>There are two types of cryptocurrency exchanges that users can choose from – Fiat exchange and Altcoin exchange. Fiat cryptocurrency exchanges enable users to buy cryptocurrencies with fiat money like dollars, euros, pounds and using a cash or credit card. Whereas, Altcoin exchanges don’t let users transact through credit cards or banks and instead require that you make a crypto deposit first which users can use later to trade for other coins.</p>

						<h3>Types of Cryptocurrency Wallet</h3>
					</div>
					<div>
						<span>Mobile Wallet</span>
						<p>Basically, mobile wallets are the apps running on smartphones and often compact because of the phone memory limitations. These wallets are majorly used by retailers who accept digital currency.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<span>Software Wallet</span>
						<p>Usually, they run on desktops and mobile platforms and provide quick transfers to your local currency with the multi-sig support. Software wallets are used to store your private key on the desktop.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<span>Hardware Wallet</span>
						<p>Contrary to software wallets, hardware wallet makes use of the hardware device to keep private keys offline, promoting the transactions to be done using a USB key. The process of using hardware wallet is simple, so just connect the wallet to the computer, enter a pin and carry on with the transactions.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<span>Web Wallet</span>
						<p>They are amongst the most convenient wallets as they run in the cold network and can be easily accessed from any location. They can be accessed from any location and that makes them very convenient, but as your private keys are controlled by a third party, they are vulnerable to hacking attempts. </p>

					<h3>Cryptocurrency Wallet Development – Biometric Solution</h3>
					<p>We all know that digital currencies have been stored in digital wallets where security is a significant challenge. Our technology experts have come up with a model that uses biometric methods to secure digital currencies within wallets. This would further improve the usability and security of payment transactions carried out with digital currencies which are stored in wallets, by using the fingerprint of users.</p>
					<p>Further, Biometric based wallet protects the digital assets and transaction process with two phase authentication system that employs fingerprint and password authentication. All personal data are stored locally. On the basis of personal preferences of a user, private and public keys can be stored at the cloud server in an encrypted way except the fingerprint data.</p>

					<h2>Emergence of Cryptocurrency Exchange Development in Various Industries</h2>
					<p>In the wake of the crypto big bang, thousands of new cryptocurrencies have emerged and expanded the ever-expanding cryptocurrency exchange software development market. Over the last few years, many industries have been disrupted by the introduction of cryptocurrencies as a means of transferable value. </p>
				</div>

					<img src="image/img/blockchain-sol/finance-icon.png" width="21px" height="21px" alt="Cryptocurrency exchange development services">
					<span>Finance</span>
					<p>If there is one industry which is about to be revamped from top to bottom by leveraging blockchain technology is FINANCE. The financial shift is going to come with passive actions or value being exchanged without two individuals needing to interact directly. For example, funds being automatically withdrawn from your account when you exit a grocery store.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4 col-sm-4 col-md-4 card4">
					<img src="image/img/blockchain-sol/Healthare-icon.png" width="21px" height="21px" alt="Cryptocurrency exchange development company">
					<span>Healthcare</span>
					<p> When it comes to sharing and storing medical data, the healthcare industry has been in need of a significant disruption. The potential for error, lost records and fraud has given a rise to distrust between consumers and healthcare service providers. Blockchain technology can revamp the trust by securely storing medical records which can be safely accessed by the doctors and authorized people. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4 col-sm-4 col-md-4 card3">
					<img src="image/img/blockchain-sol/Banking-icon.png" width="21px" height="21px" alt="Cryptocurrency exchange development">
					<span>Banking</span>
					<p>At present, banks store money for their customers and also handle the transfer. Blockchain inherently has a secure system which would provide permanent records of the millions of transactions that take place in the banking industry every day. This ledger system can lower the risk by providing secure records and money could be transferred faster by the decentralization nature of blockchain. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-4 col-sm-4 col-md-4 card4">
					<img src="image/img/blockchain-sol/real-estate-icon.png" width="21px" height="21px" alt="Crypto exchange development">
					<span>Real estate</span>
					<p> Anyone who has ever bought or sold a home very well knows just how much paperwork is involved in a real estate transaction. Cryptocurrency exchange development has the potential to completely change the current headache that all of these documents cause. By using blockchain technology, all of the transaction records and documents can be stored securely with less work and less cost. </p>

					<img src="image/img/blockchain-sol/education-icon.png" width="21px" height="21px" alt="cryptocurrency exchange platform development">
					<span>Education</span>
					<p> The education industry is definitely going to see some significant breakthroughs utilizing an evolving version of the Internet that combines blockchain, cryptocurrency and virtual reality. The new Internet will be known as “3DInternet” and it has the power to create a global classroom. Blockchain-distributed ledger technology provides a safe and auditable way to record and transfer data.  </p>

					<span>Internet of Things</span>
					<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) promises an ever-increasing number of online devices to contribute effectively to our well connected lifestyle. However, a significant barrier to the adoption of several smart gadgets is the walled ecosystem which a few manufacturers really insist upon, locking out devices from other vendors and making things difficult for the customer planning to use a diverse variety of bits of hardware.</p>
